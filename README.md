#Solar Flare Prediction

ESILV Project: Python for Data Analysis 2022

##Context:

A solar flare is an intense eruption of electromagnetic radiation in the Sun's atmosphere. Flares occur in active regions 
and are often but not always, accompanied by coronal mass ejections, solar particle events, and other solar phenoma.
The peak flux in energy (Watts per square metre) determine the class of the solar flares using the letters(A, B, C, M or X).

##Objective:
The goal of this project is to see if we can use other parameters coming from an active region of the sun to see if we can 
determine the class of the solar flare without having to measure the energy radiating from it.
To make our prediction, we're using data such as sunspot distribution, size... 
The dataset is visible here:https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Solar+Flare

##Technologies:
Python 3.7.4, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn, matplotlib

##API:
I couldn't implement a django or flask API due to lack of time and knowledge in the domain.
